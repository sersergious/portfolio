                  Beyond the code and equations, I'm driven by a deep curiosity
                  about how things work and a desire to push the boundaries of
                  what's possible. Every problem is a puzzle waiting to be
                  solved, every limitation an opportunity for innovation. I
                  believe in the power of technology to amplify human potential
                  and create a better future for all.

                  My family is my foundation. Everything I do is inspired by
                  them and for them. Their unwavering support fuels my
                  determination to pursue excellence with rigor and curiosity.
                  As someone working at the intersection of Computer Science and
                  Mathematics, I believe that every tool I create and every
                  piece of research I explore holds the potential to
                  meaningfully improve the lives of those around me.
