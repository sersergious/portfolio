## Architecture & Design Decisions

I selected Next.js for its performance, flexibility, and seamless server-side rendering.
Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui gave me fast, consistent styling.
MDX lets me write content in markdown while embedding interactive components, making blog and research posts richer while retaining simplicity of content management.
